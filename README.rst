What does it do?
----------------

The package provides additional tasks for deployer (deployer.org) for synchronising databases between instances.
The most useful is "db:pull [target]" task which allows you to pull database from target instance.

Installation
------------

1) Install package with composer:
::

   composer require sourcebroker/deployer-extended-database


2) If you are using deployer as composer package then just put following line in your deploy.php:
::

   new \SourceBroker\DeployerExtendedDatabase\Loader();


3) If you are using deployer as phar then put following lines in your deploy.php:
::

   require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
   new \SourceBroker\DeployerExtendedDatabase\Loader();

4) After that create ".env" file in your root with one line.
The INSTANCE must correspond to server() name.
::

   INSTANCE="local"

You need to put the .env file with proper INSTANCE name on each of you instances.

Options
-------

- | **caching_tables**
  | *default value:* null
  |
  | Tables that will be truncated with task `db:truncate`_. Usually it should be some caching tables that
    should be truncated while deployment.

  |
- | **ignore_tables_out**
  | *default value:* null
  |
  | Tables that will be ignored while pulling database from target instance with task `db:pull`_

  |
- | **post_sql_in**
  | *default value:* null
  |
  | SQL that will be executed after importing database on current instance.

|
There is support to synchronise more than one database. Below and example for two database config.
All of the arrays in each database defined by key will be merged.
::

   set(
       'db_databases',
       [
           'database_foo' => [
               [
                   'host' => '127.0.0.1',
                   'database' => 'foo',
                   'user' => 'foo',
                   'password' => 'foopass',
               ],
               get('db_default')
           ],
           'database_bar' => [
               [
                   'host' => '127.0.0.1',
                   'database' => 'bar',
                   'user' => 'bar',
                   'password' => 'barpass',
               ],
               get('db_default'),
               get('current_dir') . '/path/to/file/with/config_array.php'
           ],
       ]
   );

Example configuration for TYPO3:
::

   set('db_default', [
       'caching_tables' => [
           'cf_.*'
       ],
       'ignore_tables_out' => [
           'cf_.*',
           'cache_.*',
           'be_sessions',
           'sys_history',
           'sys_file_processedfile',
           'sys_log',
           'sys_refindex',
           'tx_devlog',
           'tx_extensionmanager_domain_model_extension',
           'tx_realurl_chashcache',
           'tx_realurl_errorlog',
           'tx_realurl_pathcache',
           'tx_realurl_uniqalias',
           'tx_realurl_urldecodecache',
           'tx_realurl_urlencodecache',
           'tx_powermail_domain_model_mails',
           'tx_powermail_domain_model_answers',
           'tx_solr_.*',
           'tx_crawler_queue',
           'tx_crawler_process',
       ],
       'post_sql_in' => ''
   ]);


Tasks
-----

db:download
+++++++++++

Download database from target instance to current instance.
There is required option --dumpcode to be passed.

**Example**
::

   dep db:download live --dumpcode=0772a8d396911951022db5ea385535f6

db:export
+++++++++

Export database to database storage on current instance. The database will be stored in two separate files.
One with tables structure. The second with data only. This tasks return json structure with dumpcode to
be used in other tasks.

**Example**

Example task call:
::

   dep db:export

Example output files:
::

   2017-02-26_14:56:08#server:live#dbcode:database_default#type:data#dumpcode:362d7ca0ff065f489c9b79d0a73720f5.sql
   2017-02-26_14:56:08#server:live#dbcode:database_default#type:structure#dumpcode:362d7ca0ff065f489c9b79d0a73720f5.sql

db:import
+++++++++

Import database from current instance database storage. There is required option --dumpcode to be passed.

**Example**
::

   dep db:import --dumpcode=0772a8d396911951022db5ea385535f66

db:move
+++++++

This command allows you to move database between instances.
In the background it runs several other tasks to accomplish this.

Here is the list of tasks that will be done afer "db:move":

1) First it runs `db:export`_ task on target instance and get the "dumpcode" as return to use it in next commands.
2) Then it runs `db:download`_ on current instance (with "dumpcode" value from first task).
3) Then it runs `db:process`_ on current instance (with "dumpcode" value from first task).
4) Then it runs `db:upload`_ on current instance (with "dumpcode" value from first task).
5) Then it runs `db:import`_ on target instance (with "dumpcode" value from first task).


**Example**

Example call when you are on your local instance can be:
::

   dep db:move live dev

db:process
++++++++++

This command will run some defined commands on pure sql file as its sometimes needed to remove or replace some strings
directly on sql file before importing. There is required option --dumpcode to be passed.

**Example**
::

   dep db:process --dumpcode=0772a8d396911951022db5ea385535f66


db:pull
+++++++

This command allows you to pull database from target instance to current instance.
In the background it runs several other tasks to accomplish this.

Here is the list of tasks that will be done afer "db:pull":

1) First it runs `db:export`_ task on target instance and get the "dumpcode" as return to use it in next commands.
2) Then it runs `db:download`_ on current instance (with "dumpcode" value from first task).
3) Then it runs `db:process`_ on current instance (with "dumpcode" value from first task).
4) Then it runs `db:import`_ on current instance (with "dumpcode" value from first task).

**Example**
::

   dep db:pull live

db:truncate
+++++++++++

This command allows you to truncate database tables defined in database config var "caching_tables"

**Example**
::

   dep db:truncate --dumpcode=0772a8d396911951022db5ea385535f6


db:upload
+++++++++

This command uploads the sql dump file to target instance.
There is required option --dumpcode to be passed.

**Example**

Upload database with dumpcode 0772a8d396911951022db5ea385535f6 to live instance
and store it on database storage folder.

::
